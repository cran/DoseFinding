	in optLoc)
      * MCPMod passes direction argument now also to TD
      * optDesign solnp is now the default optimizer

2013-01-09 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.9-1)
      * Complete re-structuring and tidying up of the package. 
	Main ideas: (i) smoother integration of g-functions (ii) focus on
	core functionality (iii) more general code/easier extensibility.
      * New features: Bayesian dose-response fitting, nicer plots,
	optimal designs for non-normal responses, ...
      * Special Thanks to Tobias Mielke for testing of the package and 
	numerous bug reports.
      * Previous versions of the source are available under 
	http://cran.r-project.org/package=DoseFinding under 
	"Old sources", a Windows binary of the last version 
	before the changes is available under http://goo.gl/p1UZ7.

2012-08-22 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.6-3)
      * Added PACKAGE = "DoseFinding" to ".C" calls

2012-04-04 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.6-2)
      * calcOptDesign partial rewrite of optDes.c and optDesign.R
      to fix segfault bug.

2012-02-20 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.6-1)
      * vcov.gDRMod is now functional, predict.gDRMod now allows
      calculation of confidence intervals
      * gFitDRModel minor changes in underlying optimizer
      * explicitly export the gradients of the model functions now

2012-01-24 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.5-7)
      * gFitDRModel now always returns an estimate (either the
      best value from nlminb or from the grid search if nlminb fails)
      * gMCPtest: use sigma = corMat instead of corr = corMat in
      p/qmvnorm calls (mvtnorm complained in 1-dimensional case)
      * gFitDRModel: Introduced default for bnds argument.
      * plot.MCPMod: Plot clinRel in the right place, when direction is
      equal to "decreasing" (thanks to Jan Rekowski)
      * planMM, critVal: When vCov is specified now right correlation 
      matrix is calculated
      * calcOptDesign: Additional argument (standDopt) to allow for optional
      standardization (division of the log determinant by the number 
      of parameters) of the D-optimal design criterion. 

2011-10-19 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.5-6)
    * getGrid corrected bug for Ngrd > 75025
    * calcOptDesign: For method = "exact" and n2 > 0 the function
      did not return the optimal incremental design but the
      overall optimal design

2011-08-31 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.5-5)
    * gFitDRModel can now fit dose-response models without
      intercept
    * gMCPtest minor changes to allow for user defined contrast
      matrix

2011-08-09 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.5-4)
    * MCPtest now uses correct degrees of freedom if addCovars != ~1
    * Feedback from Andreas Krause led to a number 
      smaller changes in the package (e.g., plot.(g)DRMod or 
      fitDRModel). Thanks Andreas!
    * Print lattice plots explicitly to increase compability
      with Sweave.

2011-05-06 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.5-3)
    * Ensure in rndDesign that N is recognized as
      an integer by using N <- round(N), to avoid floating point
      problems.
    * Remove naming bug in gFitDRModel (drFit instead of drEst)

2011-04-27 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.5-2)
    * Corrected bug in b-vector for sigEmax model (calcBvec,
      only affected MED-type optimal designs)
    * Included INDEX file to order the overview help-page better
    * predict.DRMod now stops when type = "fullModel" and the
      argument newdata does not contain values for all variables
      specified in addCovars (thanks to Mouna). 

2011-03-25 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.5-1)
    * Restructured calcOptDesign function to allow for user
      defined criteria functions.
    * The MCPMod object now always contains a estDose and fm
      entry (which is NA in case of non-significance or non-convergence)
    * Added generalized fitting code, variances and covariances of 
      estimates are not available at the moment.
    * Added vCov argument to planMM, sampSize, powerMM (so it is possible
      to take into account covariances when calculating optimal contrasts)
    * Changed order in trellis plots in plotModels (order as specified in
      models list instead of alphanumerical order)
    * Restructured and summarized help pages 
    * Removed dependency on numDeriv package (only suggested now),
      this is only needed for calculating optimal designs involving
      the beta model.

2011-02-09 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.4-3)
    * Minor change in Makevars file (so that DoseFinding works on 
      Solaris).

2011-02-09 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.4-2)
    * calcBayesEst, getUpdDesign: Minor changes to make functions
      more suited for general purpose use.

2010-12-01 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.4-1)
    * Introduced new functions calcBayesEst and getUpdDesign,
      both were used for simulation purposes in the paper
      Bornkamp et al. (2011) "Response Adaptive Dose-Finding
      under Model Uncertainty" (to appear in Annals of Applied
      Statistics).
	
2010-11-12 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.3-1)
    * calcOptDesign now has an additional optimizer "exact". This
      methods calculates all possible designs for a given sample size
      and then selects the best.
    * Changed order in MakeVars as requested
    * calcCrit now checks whether there are not less design points
      than parameters.
    * Code now checks for positive sigma in powCalc and powerMM
	
2010-11-05 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.2-3)
    * MED function now checks for clinRel > 0 (thanks to Georgina).
    * Changed minor bug in output from print.MCPtest (print one-sided
      just once)
    * Code now outputs a warning, when 'models' argument is missing
      (in MCPMod and fullMod function); in fitDRModel it outputs 
      a warning if 'model' is missing
    * Introduced a default base = 0 and maxEff = 1 for the plotModels
      function.
    * Added a summary method for DRMod objects.
    * Removed superfluous addCovarVals argument from predict.DRMod
    * Removed option method = "mult" in calcOptDesign

2010-07-08 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.2-2)
    * calcCrit and calcOptDesign now check for NA, NaN or +-Inf
      values in the gradient and bvector (and stop execution when
      these values occur) before passing these values to the C
      code.
    * Introduced a logLik method for DRMod objects
    * Changed mvtnorm.control default argument for "interval"
      to reflect recent changes in mvtnorm package.

2010-05-27 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.2-1)
    * Made the getGrad function (gradient for dose-response model),
      including documentation available for end-user (was previously
      hidden in NAMESPACE)
    * Changes in the plot.MCPMod function (col argument for 
      panel.superpose was read in different order depending on
      lattice options, now there is a manual workaround with
      panel.xyplot calls for each group)


2010-05-20 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.1-3)
    * Smaller changes in calcCrit functions (the parameter p is
      now calculated by the nPars function as in getOptDesign)
    * Add further options to powerScenario function (now possible
      to for user-specified row and column names for output matrix)


2010-05-13 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.1-2)
    * Removed one example from sampSize to reduce check time.
    * modelSelect: Use first model when two models have exactly
      the same AIC or BIC value.
    * predict.DRMod: Return NA as standard deviation if code
      cannot calculate Cholesky transformation of covariance
      matrix (thanks to Setia Pramana for the hint).
    * calcCrit: Code now allows for specifying multiple designs
      in a matrix.
	
2010-04-14 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.1-1)
    * fitModel.nls now checks whether nls with plinear option made
      a positive number of iterations (as additional convergence check).
      In some cases (eg. when number of parameters = number of 
      doses) plinear does not do any iteration and does *not* 
      put out a warning message that the algorithm failed.
    * The calcOptDesign function now allows for upper and lower bounds
      on the allocation weights.
    * There is no longer the need to specify clinRel, when one wants
      to calculate a D-optimal design.
    * Output of bootMCPMod function in case of model averaging now
      also includes dose estimates under each model & corrected
      bug in print.bootMCPMod function (thanks to Setia Pramana)

2010-03-08 Bjoern Bornkamp (version 0.1)
    * 1st Release as version 0.1. Improvements over MCPMod package:
      - Extended and improved version of MCPMod (allowing for covariates
        and robustified self-developed optimizer)
      - Functions for MCP (MCPtest) and Modelling (fitDRModel) part
        now available to the user
      - New functions (eg. bootMCPMod, powerScenario)
      - Functions for calculating optimal designs
